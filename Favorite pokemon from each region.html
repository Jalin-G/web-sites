<p class="alaka"> Alakazam is a specialy sound pokemon hosting a commandind 135 special attack and a formidable 95 special defense, even though this pokemon has a horrid 40 physical defense It makes up with its zippy base 120 speed stat which allows it to make the first move quickly and effectively but with caution </p>
